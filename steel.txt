-| Tool steel
   in general all tool steel offered by 3dhubs have good magnetic
      properties
   the ones not listed are more expensive than d2/a2/a3
   wall thickness 0.75 mm

   -| Tool steel D2 1.2379
      https://www.hubs.com/cnc-machining/metal/tool-steel/tool-steel-d2/
      magnetic
      not super expensive
      electrical resistivity 65 - 70 μΩ*cm

   -| Tool steel A2 1.2363
      https://www.hubs.com/cnc-machining/metal/tool-steel/tool-steel-a2/
      magnetic
      fractionally less expensive than d2

   -| Tool steel A3
      https://www.hubs.com/cnc-machining/metal/tool-steel/tool-steel-a3/
      magnetic
      fractionally less expensive than a2
      good hardness
